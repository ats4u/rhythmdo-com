### Memo

I am processing many categories one by one. And this time I am processing only Plosives.

Are these okay to explain all the English consonants including all of the dialects?

### Memo 2

Labial-velar stops [k͡p], [ɡ͡b] occur in some English pidgins/creoles (West African Englishes). If you intend to cover all dialects, maybe worth a note.

Uvular [q, ʁ] appear in some extreme contact dialects (e.g., Gaelic-influenced Hebrides English), though very marginal.

Flap [ɾ] deserves a table row, since it’s the standard intervocalic realization of /t, d/ in American English (water → [ˈwɔɾɚ]).
