[ChatGPT Chat History ](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-682db11348608191a393f6d13c3905e8-others/c/689b3554-c4e4-832c-8c3e-2f0b20b86029)


# Chat summary (1-minute)

* We agreed the “no-code” hype is over. AI can write lots of code, but **specification, architecture, and verification** are the leverage points.
* **Architecture ≠ coding.** Architecture sets intent, contracts, and trade-offs; coding instantiates them. Most teams conflate the two, which hides the value of design.
* Your experience: your architectural work was misread as “just coding.” AI makes this worse unless the **control layer** (spec + gates) is explicit and enforced.
* We outlined how to make control visible (artifacts) and enforceable (CI gates), so AI (and humans) can’t drift.

# “Control Layer” spec

Twelve **artifacts** (single source of truth for intent) + eight **gates** (CI checks that block drift). Names are suggestions; tweak to taste.

## 12 control artifacts (ship these into `/architecture/`)

1. **ARCH-README.md** – Vision, scope, domain language, non-goals.
2. **schema.yaml** – Content types (Theory/Example/Exercise/Glossary), fields, constraints, i18n, slugs.
3. **urls.md** – Directory-style href policy, `index.*` resolution, slug immutability, language mapping.
4. **openapi.yaml** (or tRPC/proto) – Public API, versions, error shapes.
5. **events.md** – Editorial workflow & domain events (create/review/publish), payload schemas, versioning.
6. **invariants.md** – Non-negotiables (e.g., directory hrefs only; i18n coverage; titles must exist; object-form leaf text as fallback; inline HTML in titles preserved).
7. **adr/** – Numbered Architecture Decision Records (Context → Decision → Consequences).
8. **erd.mmd / diagram** – Entity relations (Mermaid/Draw\.io) for DB + content relations.
9. **security.md** – Roles, authN/Z rules, rate-limits, PII handling, threat checklist.
10. **test-matrix.md** – Unit/contract/snapshot/acceptance; fixtures; coverage floor.
11. **publishing-and-export.md** – Quarto/LaTeX/PDF parity rules, sidebar/TOC source of truth, link policy.
12. **tooling-and-intent.md** – Codegen config, lint/typecheck rules, **intent-header** comment template, PR template pointers.

> Why 12? Together they describe *what must be true* of Rhythmpedia across app, data, and publishing—so AI can implement safely and CI can verify objectively.

## 8 enforcement gates (CI must block on failure)

1. **Schema drift gate**

   * Regenerate types/validators from `schema.yaml` (e.g., Prisma + Zod). Fail on diff.
2. **API contract gate**

   * Compare `openapi.yaml` vs main (e.g., `openapi-diff`); fail on breaking changes.
3. **Invariants gate**

   * Scripted checks for URL rules, i18n field presence, slug immutability, title required, inline-HTML allowed.
4. **Dependency boundary gate**

   * Enforce layer rules (e.g., depcruise/ESLint import rules).
5. **Migration gate**

   * Apply `up` then `down` on a fresh DB; fail on irreversibles or data-loss flags.
6. **Tests & types gate**

   * Run unit + contract + snapshot + acceptance; enforce coverage; TS typecheck.
7. **Publishing parity gate**

   * Build Quarto, verify sidebar/TOC, check directory-href links, dead links, missing titles.
8. **Security & supply-chain gate**

   * Secret scan, dependency audit (OSV/NPM), SAST lint, license allowlist.

> Operating rule: **If an invariant isn’t enforced by a gate, it will be ignored.** The artifacts document intent; the gates make it real.

## Optional Rhythmpedia defaults (quick start)

* **Invariants shortlist** to seed `invariants.md`:
  directory-hrefs only · slug immutable · index.\* ⇒ directory URL · titles required · i18n coverage required · object-form leaf text is fallback only · inline HTML in titles preserved · export parity with Quarto.

If you want, I can output a **starter kit** (all 12 files + CI skeleton) tailored to Rhythmpedia.

## Related topics you might want next

* “Generate the 12 control artifacts with Rhythmpedia defaults.”
* “Create GitHub Actions YAML implementing the 8 gates.”
* “Draft 6 example ADRs (URLs, i18n model, events, security model, tests, exports).”

## Background that helps (even if not requested)

* Treat prompts as **executable design docs**; keep them versioned and referenced in PRs.
* Short loops win: change spec → regen code → run gates → ship.
* Make intent visible inside code: top-of-file **intent headers** (What/Why/Inputs/Outputs/Invariants/Risks).
